# Stale entities and entity ids

Home Assistant keeps an entity id after the integration that made it stops using it. This page answers the questions that follow from that rule, and explains how to clean up.

## Why does an entity id never change on its own?

Home Assistant builds an entity id once, when the entity registers for the first time. After that the id is stored, and no later change moves it. A device rename does not move it. An area change does not move it. An integration update does not move it.

Removing the integration does not move it either. Home Assistant remembers a removed entity for 30 days. If you add the integration again inside that window, the old entity id comes back, together with the name you gave the entity and the area you put it in.

This is good behavior. Your automations keep working across an update, a rename, and a reinstall.

## A release changed how entity ids look. Did my ids change?

No. Your install keeps the ids it already has. A fresh install gets the new form. Both forms work, and nothing forces you to change.

Every `0.0.x` release is beta, and none of them carries a migration. A release can therefore change the id form, and the same rule applies each time. Version 0.0.12 is one example. A fresh install of 0.0.12 or later uses ids of the form `light.ampio_47846_obj_7`. An install created before 0.0.12 keeps ids of the form `light.ampio_module_0xc9ae_osw_obwod_1`.

If you want the new form on an existing install, use the reset procedure below. It is a support procedure. No update requires it.

## Back up first

Do not start either procedure below without a backup. Both delete records that Home Assistant cannot rebuild from the Ampio server.

1. Open Settings, then System, then Backups.
2. Select "Create backup".
3. Wait for the backup to finish.

## How do I remove a few stale entities?

Use this when Ampio Designer no longer has an object, and its entity is still listed. Such an entity shows the state `unavailable` or the label "restored".

1. Open Settings, then Devices and Services, then Entities.
2. Search for the entity.
3. Select it, then select the cog icon.
4. Select "Delete".

If the "Delete" button is not offered, the integration still creates that entity. Check Ampio Designer before you go further.

## How do I reset every Ampio entity id?

Use this to move an existing install onto the current id form. The procedure deletes every Ampio entity record, so Home Assistant builds the ids again from scratch on the next start.

**Every automation, script, scene, and dashboard card that names an Ampio entity id stops working.** Write those ids down first, and plan to repoint them.

You need shell access to the Home Assistant host, through the SSH add-on or the Terminal add-on.

1. Take a backup, as described above.
2. Write down the Ampio entity ids your automations use.
3. Stop Home Assistant:

   ```sh
   ha core stop
   ```

4. Copy the entity registry, then remove every Ampio record from it:

   ```sh
   sudo cp /config/.storage/core.entity_registry /config/.storage/core.entity_registry.bak
   sudo jq '(.data.entities, .data.deleted_entities) |= map(select(.platform != "ampio"))' \
     /config/.storage/core.entity_registry > /tmp/registry.json
   sudo cp /tmp/registry.json /config/.storage/core.entity_registry
   ```

5. Start Home Assistant:

   ```sh
   ha core start
   ```

6. Open Settings, then Devices and Services, then Ampio. Confirm that the entity count matches what you had.
7. Repoint your automations at the new ids.

The `deleted_entities` list matters as much as the `entities` list. Leave the deleted records in place, and Home Assistant restores every old id on the next start.

### If something goes wrong

Stop Home Assistant, copy the backup file back, then start Home Assistant:

```sh
ha core stop
sudo cp /config/.storage/core.entity_registry.bak /config/.storage/core.entity_registry
ha core start
```

If the instance does not start at all, restore the full backup from Settings, System, Backups.

## What this does not touch

- Your Ampio configuration. The M-SERV holds it, and this integration only reads it.
- Your devices. Device names and areas live in a separate registry.
- Any other integration. The filter selects the `ampio` platform alone.
